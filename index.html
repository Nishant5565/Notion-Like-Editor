        Muzan, that would be the end of it, had not we?<br /><br />But the

        our assumptions and proved us incorrect!<br /><br />Indeed, you did read
        that correctly.<br /><br />To answer your question in a nutshell,
        Tanjiro transforms into a demon in chapter 201!<br /><br />This was

      <strong>For what reason did Muzan transform Tanjiro into a demon?</strong>

        >Throughout the entirety of Demon Slayer, the idea that ideas serve as a
        potent weapon in their own right is consistently communicated.<br /><br />In
        the latter moments of his life, Muzan comes to the realization that this
        phenomenon also applies to him.<br /><br />Now when she is on the verge
        of passing away, Muzan acknowledges that sentiments are unending and
        unending.<br /><br />He admitted that the emotions of those he had slain
        had at long last had the opportunity to work their way through him.<br /><br />The
        significance of the concept of how strong sentiments are was brought
        into more focus by this.<br /><br />As a result, Muzan came to the
        conclusion that it would be beneficial for him to demonstrate this for
        himself.<br /><br />Also Read: </span

        ><br /><br />After coming to the conclusion that his own sentiments for
        his aspirations would be sufficient to overpower those of a Tanjiro who
        was on the verge of death, Muzan begins the process of transferring his
        blood.<br /><br />Through the use of symbols, he imparts his will onto
        the little youngster.<br /><br />It was Muzan's desire for Tanjiro to
        continue working toward his own self-serving objective of destroying the
        Demon Slayer Corps. (Consuming that he were to make it through this
        peculiar blood transfusion).<br /><br />The purpose of Muzan's blood
        donation to Tanjiro is to transform him into a demon so that he can
        continue his wicked ministry.<br /><br />In terms of becoming the future
        leader of demons, often known as the "King of Demons," Tanjiro was the
        ideal choice to take on this role.<br /><br />The first thing that he
        did was share blood with Nezuko, which made it possible for him to stand
        in the sun.<br /><br />Second, he honed his Sun Breathing skills in the
        same way as Yoriichi did, which would result in his becoming even more
        strong.<br /><br /><mark

      <br />One other thing that serves as a reminder of the power of human
      interactions is the scene in which Tanjiro is attempting to return to
      having human characteristics. After becoming a demon, Tanjiro lost control
      of his body.<br /><br />He went so far as to assault Nezuko, and the mere
      act of tasting her blood sparked his want to consume more of it.<br /><br />When
      Inosuke thinks back on the pledges he made with Tanjiro and Zenitsu, he
      remembers how the three of them had promised to always look out for each
      other.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Tanjiro is now the most powerful
      demon, the majority of the attempts to kill him were unsuccessful.<br /><br />Also
      Read: <span>Higehiro Ending Explained</span><br /><br />Even the ruby red
      nichirin swords were unable to defeat him even when they were used.<br /><br />Using
      the last bottle of wisteria poison that was available, Kanao was
      eventually successful in stabbing the demon Tanjiro.<br /><br />From this
      point forward, it appears like Tanjiro is on the verge of passing away,
      and Muzan is doing all in his power to get him to acknowledge that he is a
      demon.<br /><br />We can demonstrate how shallow Muzan's grasp of feelings
      was by looking at this one instance.<br /><br />As he reprimands Tanjiro,
      he is attempting to convey to him that people who have passed away would
      not be pleased with his coming back even after they have passed away.<br /><br />As
      an additional point of interest, he continues to declare that he is the
      inheritor of his will, which is a pitiful attempt to use "feelings" to
      assist in still maintaining power.<br /><br />Despite the fact that they
      are already deceased, Tanjiro remembers that his fellow soldiers would
      never wish for anybody to suffer as much as they did.<br /><br />Muzan is
      informed by Tanjiro that none of his deceased brothers and sisters would
      be upset if he were to go back to human form.<br /><br />The delight of
      being a human being comes from sharing your highs and lows with the people
      you care about.<br /><br />This is the lesson that we learn from this
      experience: the sentiments that bond people together are powerful and are
      the consequence of many sacrifices making.<br /><br />Tanjiro gradually
      regains consciousness as he recalls both the anguish and the happiness
      that he had.<br /><br />He admits that even the happiness that he
      experienced in the past was sufficient for him to turn back.<br /><br />When
      it was all said and done, Tanjiro, who had been comatose, opened his eyes
      once more, but this time they were human!<br /><br />In light of this,
      Tanjiro was successful in defeating Muzan and regaining his human
      existence.<br /><br />Also Read:

      ><br /><br />Through the force of their love and faith, everyone is able
      to bring Tanjiro back to his human state.<br /><br />Suddenly, Tanjiro
      regains his humanity.

      <strong>Is this a missed opportunity?</strong>
    </h2>
    <p data-id="c64ccf1a-1924-4f55-b67c-30d1c3ec826d" style="text-align: left">
      Despite the fact that Tanjiro's transformation into a demon was intended
      to further further develop a theme for the last time and add more
      excitement after the finale, his time spent as a demon Tanjiro was rather
      brief.<br /><br />Tanjiro's three-chapter demon-hood appeared odd, maybe
      as a result of the fact that the protagonist of their manga had made the
      transition into the non-human adversary species on several occasions.<br /><br />As
      a result of this, it was a stunning demonstration of love and bravery,
      which further demonstrated how much the characters love one other in the
      last scene.<br /><br />In addition, it acts as a lesson for the readers,
      which is that putting value on the people you care about and the wonderful
      memories you have may help you triumph against the most formidable
      adversaries.<br /><br />The self-centered and ruminative behaviors of
      demons, which stood in stark contrast to those of humans and were the
      fatal defect of the former, are brought to light by this.<br /><br />If
      there had been a sequel to Demon Slayer, it would have been incredible to
      watch Tanjiro fighting his demons (please laugh), and possibly even
      becoming an opponent in the story.<br /><br />I still believe that Demon
      Slayer might have been a foundation for more Demon Slayer content that
      would have further explored the functional human interactions as opposed
      to the lonely behavior of the majority of demons.<br /><br />This is
      despite the fact that Demon Slayer concluded with an exceptionally
      successful run before it was cancelled.<br /><br />Should not you have
      anticipated more from the demon tanjiro?<br /><br />Do you believe that
      the tale came to a satisfactory conclusion?<br /><br />Post your thoughts
